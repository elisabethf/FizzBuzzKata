# fizz-buzz-kata
Kata for teambuilding November 2023

### Requirements
Write a “fizzBuzz” method that accepts a number as input and returns it as a String.
For multiples of three return “Fizz” instead of the number
For the multiples of five return “Buzz”
For numbers that are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”.

### Notes:
start with the minimal failing solution
keep the three rules in mind and always write just enough code to make the test pass
do not forget to refactor your code after each passing test
write your assertions relating to the exact requirements
